# Database of avian reproductive times
For a set of migratory birds of eastern temperate forest, we aim to extract all available information on arrival and nesting dates, the times required for site selection, nesting, egg laying, incubation, and fledging, and the years and geographic locations over which that information has been reported.

## Data Sources
Data will be compiled from these sources:
* [Birds of North America](birdsna.org)
* Ehrlich et al. 1988. The Birder's Handbook. Simon & Schuster, New York.

## Traits
Record min and max values for the following traits, all measured in days:
* Pair_form: time from arrival on breeding grounds until pair formation
* Site_selec: time for nest site selection
* Nest_build: time for nest building
* Pre_laying: the delay (for some species) between when the nest is finished and when egg-laying begins
* Egg_laying: time for egg laying (which should be equal to clutch size, at one egg per day)
* Incubation: time for incubation
* Nestling: time from hatching to fledging
* Post_fledging: time during which fledglings continue to be fed by parents after fledging


## Notes
* We would like information on _first_ nesting attempts.
