## Traits
Record min and max values for the following traits, all measured in days:
* Pair_form: time from arrival on breeding grounds until pair formation
* Site_selec: time for nest site selection
* Nest_build: time for nest building
* Pre_laying: the delay (for some species) between when the nest is finished and when egg-laying begins
* Egg_laying: time for egg laying (which should be equal to clutch size, at one egg per day)
* Incubation: time for incubation
